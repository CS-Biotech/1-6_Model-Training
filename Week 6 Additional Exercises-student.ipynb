    "In this module, we will revisit the Heart failure dataset that you have seen before. We want to perform logistic regression on our model and evaluate its accuracy. You will apply what you have learned from the main module to this additional exercise. Below, we have imported the necessary modules/packages, as well as preprocessed the data in the same way that was done in the data science portion. Instatiate the model and train the model using `train_scaled` and `train_targets`. Start with a learning rate of 0.0001 and 100 epochs. Play around with the hyperparameters until you get an accuracy greater than 80%.\n",
