    "### Introduction to Class Imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's pre-module, we will explore an important concept in data preprocessing: **class imbalance**. This issue frequently arises in biological datasets — particularly when studying rare diseases — where one class (e.g., healthy individuals) vastly outnumbers the other (e.g., patients with a rare condition). To better understand this concept, let's begin with an illustrative analogy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Dragon Analogy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a knight in a mythical land, tasked with a crucial mission: to identify dragons among a vast array of animals. According to legend, collecting enough dragon scales grants immortality. However, there's a challenge – dragons are incredibly rare, and until recently, no one had ever seen one. Recently, two dragons have been captured, providing you with your first real glimpse of these elusive creatures. Armed with this limited knowledge, you set out on your quest to classify animals as either **dragons** or **not dragons** – a classic **binary classification** problem. But with only two dragons ever seen, how can you confidently distinguish dragons from other animals, especially when other animals vary widely in appearance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon returning from your journey, you need to report your findings to the king. A simple way to measure your success might be to report your overall accuracy—how many dragons you correctly identified. But here’s the catch: because dragons are so rare, you could label every animal as “not a dragon” and still achieve 99.9% accuracy – after all, we know that dragons are exceedingly rare. That sounds impressive, but misses the entire point of your mission: finding the dragons, the rare 0.01%."

    "#### **The Challenge of Class Imbalance**\n",
    "This analogy illustrates a key issue in machine learning: <span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**class imbalance**</span>. When one class (e.g., dragons) is significantly underrepresented compared to another (e.g., non-dragons), traditional metrics like accuracy can be misleading. A model trained on such imbalanced data may fail to learn the distinguishing features of the minority class. If the training set only has two dragons, the model lacks enough information to learn what makes dragons unique. If the test set is also imbalanced, accuracy alone won’t reflect how well the model identifies the rare class. In such cases, alternative evaluation metrics like precision-recall and the F1 score are more informative. Additionally, we can use techniques such as resampling or apply specialized algorithms to better handle the imbalance.\n",

    "#### **Class Imbalance in Biological Data**\n",
    "In biological contexts, class imbalance is common. For example, when analyzing years of chest X-rays from a hospital, most images will likely show healthy lungs, while only a few may reveal pneumonia. In this case, the healthy images form the <span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**majority class**</span>, and the pneumonia cases form the <span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**minority class**</span>.\n"

    "Handling class imbalance is crucial in training effective machine learning models, especially in binary classification problems, which are frequently tackled using methods like logistic regression. The issue of imbalanced datasets is particularly problematic because it can lead to models that are inherently biased towards the majority class. This bias occurs for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**Learning from Frequency:**</span> Machine learning algorithms often learn by identifying patterns that are most frequent in the dataset. In an imbalanced dataset, the majority class dominates these patterns, leading the model to develop a strong bias towards it. This is because the algorithm has more examples from the majority class to learn from, making it more familiar and thus more likely to predict an instance as belonging to this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**Error Minimization Strategy:**</span> Most standard machine learning algorithms aim to minimize overall error. In a scenario where one class vastly outnumbers the other, the simplest way to achieve low error rates is by favoring the majority class. For instance, in a dataset where 95% of the samples are of the majority class, a model can achieve 95% accuracy by simply predicting every instance as the majority class, completely ignoring the minority class."

    "### 1. Penalized Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Penalized models** introduce a concept of imposing greater penalties on the model for misclassifying instances of the minority class. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets. We can adjust class weights in logistic regression to make the model pay more attention to the minority class. **Adjusting class weights** is a technique that involves modifying the weights assigned to different classes. By increasing the weight, or importance, of the minority class within the algorithm's cost function, the model is encouraged to pay more attention to the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is centered around recalibrating the model's focus to better address the imbalances. By altering the model's objective function, this approach shifts the model's attention towards more accurately predicting a particular class, in this case, instructing the model to prioritize accuracy in the minority class. This strategy is particularly relevant in scenarios where the minority class is of greater interest or importance, despite being underrepresented in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of this method is evaluated based on its ability to enhance the model's sensitivity to the minority class without compromising overall performance. While this approach can lead to a decrease in overall accuracy due to the model's increased focus on the minority class, the key benefit lies in improved detection of the underrepresented group. However, it's crucial to strike a balance to avoid overfitting the minority class, which can result in poor generalization and an increase in false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of this approach is straightforward in many logistic regression models, such as those provided by the `sklearn` library in Python. The `class_weight` parameter of `SGDclassifier` is used to specify the weights for each class. For instance, if the minority class is underrepresented by a factor of 3:1 compared to the majority class, you could assign a weight of 3 to the minority class and 1 to the majority class. This numerical adjustment tells the model to \"care\" three times as much about errors in the minority class as it does about the majority class."
